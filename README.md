# Project Overview
## Student Club Event DBMS

Hi, we are group 138!
This project was created for CPSC 304-T1-2023 for our DBMS Project.

Our project represents the admin homepage of a student club, consolidating the data of their events at large. Our design will enable student club directors to see information about attendees, venues, promotional material, and feedback data related to the event. Our web application has features to interact and manipulate the data present in the database as well as perform aggregate and filtering functions to narrow results as needed.

Cheers!

Hikaru, Vinayak, Esther
